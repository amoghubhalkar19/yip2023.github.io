              up to 70% ofwater compared to flood irrigation.
              The robot has an Arduino controller and variouselectronic components such as a high RPM motor, ablade, a
              PIR sensor, a camera, Sprinkler Nozzles, motordrivers, and a Bluetooth HC05 module for remote control.The

              This model allows for the generation of hydroelectricpower using both water and wastewater from

              water supplieswisely because water shortage is on the rise. Pollution hasincreased as a result of our
              reliance on fossil fuels. Theproject combines these ideas, so that resource overuseno longer threatens our
              planet. It operates on the dynamomotor principle. Electricity is generated when waterrotates a turbine
              connected to a dynamo motor. Afterthat, salt is used to purify the water in a storage tank atthe end of
              the trough to eliminate contaminants.

              Facilities where crops canbe produced in an enclosed environment, where almostevery factor, ranging from
              lighting and ambienttemperature to soil conditions and nutrients, are carefullycontrolled. The facility
              uses extensive vertical racking tooptimize space, as compared to a conventional crop farmenabling it to be

            the weight, the board springs back and the lever tap spring restores the original position, stopping the
            water flow. The user could use the water to take a shower, water plants or bathe a guide dog

            team developed it by using 7 plane mirrors in a honeycomb structure to capture bright and high-quality
            image. Each mirror is hexagonal in shape. The central mirror is fixed and the six side mirrors can be
            adjusted. They proposed to superimpose all seven images of the object for brighter and clear quality images.
            The telescope uses the concept of the working of a concave mirror and superimposing of images. It is
            cost-effective and eco-friendly.
